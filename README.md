# PointAndClickTest

This was a project I made in 7 hours for a challeng. The purpose was to build a point and click movement mechanic, along with colecting items when clicking on them.

The master branch is being updated with some tweaks after that time period, but the original delivery is saved in [State_at_Delivery_Time branch](https://github.com/pbelluzzo/PointAndClickTest/tree/State_at_Delivery_Time)
